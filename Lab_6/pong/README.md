# Lab 6: VGA Pong Game

This lab is an extension of Lab 3. I took the same VGA Bouncing ball display and add a moving platform controlled by a potentiometer conected by a Analog to Digital Conveter. Then a element of a shrinking platform per succesfull hit and a hexidecimal display of the score on the board were added.
